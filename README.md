### 1 Hello, Python
A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers

- Hello, Python!

Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam.

- Numbers and arithmetic in Python

- Order of operations

The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. 

Some remember these by a mnemonic such as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

- Builtin functions for working with numbers




### 2 Functions and Getting Help
Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation

- Getting Help

The help() function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. 

If you can remember how to use help(), you hold the key to understanding most other functions.

- Defining functions

- Docstrings

The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. 

When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.

- Functions that don't return

- Default arguments

- Functions Applied to Functions


### 3 Booleans and Conditionals
Using booleans for branching logic

- Booleans

- Comparison Operations

- Combining Boolean Values

- Conditionals

- Boolean conversion





### 4 Lists
Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating

- Lists

Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values.

- Indexing

- Slicing

- Changing lists

Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

- List functions

- Interlude: objects

- List methods

- Searching lists

- Tuples

Tuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.

***1***: The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets

***2***: They cannot be modified (they are immutable).





### 5 Loops and List Comprehensions
For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions

- Loops

Loops are a way to repeatedly execute some code.

      range()
      
      while loops

while loops:

The other type of loop in Python is a while loop, which iterates until some condition is met.

- List comprehensions



### 6 Strings and Dictionaries
Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types

- Strings

One place where the Python language really shines is in the manipulation of strings. 

This section will cover some of Python's built-in string methods and formatting operations.

Such string manipulation patterns come up often in the context of data science work.

- String syntax

- Strings are sequences

- String methods

- Going between strings and lists: .split() and .join()

- Building strings with .format()

- Dictionaries



### 7 Working with External Libraries
Imports, operator overloading, and survival tips for venturing into the world of external libraries

In this tutorial, you will learn about ***imports*** in Python, get some tips for working with unfamiliar libraries (and the objects they return), and dig into ***operator overloading***.


- Imports

- Other import syntax

- Submodules

- Oh the places you'll go, oh the objects you'll see

- Three tools for understanding strange objects

      1: type()
  
      2: dir()
 
      3: help()

- Operator overloading

- When does 1 + 1 not equal 2?

- Curious how it all works?


### Bonus Lessons
Apply what you've learned

These lessons arenâ€™t required for your certificate, but bridge the gap between courses and applying your new skills!
