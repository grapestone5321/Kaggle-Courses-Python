# Kaggle-Courses-Python


-------

This course covers the key Python skills youâ€™ll need, so you can start using Python for data science. 

The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience who wants to add Python to their repertoire. 

If you're a first-time coder, you are encouraged to check out our ***Intro to Programming course***, which is designed for complete beginners who would like to get started with Python.

We'll start with a brief overview of ***Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators***.



### 1 Hello, Python
A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers

- Hello, Python!

Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam.

Variable assignment: Here we create a variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator.

- Numbers and arithmetic in Python

"Number" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing

- Order of operations

The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. 

Some remember these by a mnemonic such as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

- Builtin functions for working with numbers

min and max return the minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively...

abs returns the absolute value of an argument.

In addition to being the names of Python's two main numerical types, int and float can also be called as functions which convert their arguments to the corresponding type.

### 2 Functions and Getting Help
Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation

- Getting Help

The help() function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. 

If you can remember how to use help(), you hold the key to understanding most other functions.

- Defining functions

Builtin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.

- Docstrings

The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. 

When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.

- Functions that don't return

Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. 

You can supply functions as arguments to other functions. 

- Default arguments

When we called help(print), we saw that the print function has several optional arguments. 

For example, we can specify a value for sep to put some special string in between our printed arguments.

- Functions Applied to Functions

Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions.

### 3 Booleans and Conditionals
Using booleans for branching logic

- Booleans

Python has a type of variable called bool. It has two possible values: True and False.

- Comparison Operations

Comparison operators can be combined with the arithmetic operators we've already seen to express a virtually limitless range of mathematical tests. 

For example, we can check if a number is odd by checking that the modulus with 2 returns 1.

      def is_odd(n):
          return (n % 2) == 1

      print("Is 100 odd?", is_odd(100))
      print("Is -1 odd?", is_odd(-1))

- Combining Boolean Values

You can combine boolean values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not". 

In fact, the words to do this are: and, or, and not.

With these, we can make our can_run_for_president function more accurate.

- Conditionals

Booleans are most useful when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else.

Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. 

- Boolean conversion

We've seen int(), which turns things into ints, and float(), which turns things into floats, so you might not be surprised to hear that Python has a bool() function which turns things into bools.



### 4 Lists
Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating

- Lists

Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values.

- Indexing

You can access individual list elements with square brackets.

Which planet is closest to the sun? Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has index 0.

- Slicing

What are the first three planets? We can answer this question using slicing.

- Changing lists

Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

- List functions

Python has several useful functions for working with lists.

len gives the length of a list.

- Interlude: objects

I've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that everything in Python is an object. What does that mean?

In short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.

For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. 

(You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)

- List methods

list.append modifies a list by adding an item to the end.

- Searching lists

Where does Earth fall in the order of planets? We can get its index using the list.index method.

- Tuples

Tuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.

***1***: The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets

***2***: They cannot be modified (they are immutable).





### 5 Loops and List Comprehensions
For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions

- Loops

Loops are a way to repeatedly execute some code.

      range()
      
      while loops

while loops:

The other type of loop in Python is a while loop, which iterates until some condition is met.

- List comprehensions

List comprehensions are one of Python's most beloved and unique features. 

***The Zen of Python***
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python

Readability counts.

Explicit is better than implicit.

So, use these tools to make compact readable programs. But when you have to choose, favor code that is easy for others to understand.

### 6 Strings and Dictionaries
Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types

- Strings

One place where the Python language really shines is in the manipulation of strings. 

This section will cover some of Python's built-in string methods and formatting operations.

Such string manipulation patterns come up often in the context of data science work.

- String syntax

Double quotes are convenient if your string contains a single quote character (e.g. representing an apostrophe).

Similarly, it's easy to create a string that contains double-quotes if you wrap it in single quotes.

- Strings are sequences

Strings can be thought of as sequences of characters. Almost everything we've seen that we can do to a list, we can also do to a string.

- String methods

Like list, the type str has lots of very useful methods.

- Going between strings and lists: .split() and .join()

str.split() turns a string into a list of smaller strings, breaking on whitespace by default. 

This is super useful for taking you from one big string to a list of words.

- Building strings with .format()

Python lets us concatenate strings with the + operator.

- Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a built-in Python data structure for mapping keys to values.


### 7 Working with External Libraries
Imports, operator overloading, and survival tips for venturing into the world of external libraries

In this tutorial, you will learn about ***imports*** in Python, get some tips for working with unfamiliar libraries (and the objects they return), and dig into ***operator overloading***.


- Imports

So far we've talked about types and functions which are built-in to the language.

But one of the best things about Python (especially if you're a data scientist) is the vast number of high-quality custom libraries that have been written for it.

Some of these libraries are in the "standard library", meaning you can find them anywhere you run Python. Other libraries can be easily added, even if they aren't always shipped with Python.

Either way, we'll access this code with imports.

We'll start our example by importing math from the standard library.

- Other import syntax

If we know we'll be using functions in math frequently we can import it under a shorter alias to save some typing (though in this case "math" is already pretty short).

- Submodules

We've seen that modules contain variables which can refer to functions or values. Something to be aware of is that they can also have variables referring to other modules.

- Oh the places you'll go, oh the objects you'll see

So after 6 lessons, you're a pro with ints, floats, bools, lists, strings, and dicts (right?).

Even if that were true, it doesn't end there. As you work with various libraries for specialized tasks, you'll find that they define their own types which you'll have to learn to work with. For example, if you work with the graphing library matplotlib, you'll be coming into contact with objects it defines which represent Subplots, Figures, TickMarks, and Annotations. pandas functions will give you DataFrames and Series.

- Three tools for understanding strange objects

      1: type()
  
      2: dir()
 
      3: help()

- Operator overloading

We might think that Python strictly polices how pieces of its core syntax behave such as +, <, in, ==, or square brackets for indexing and slicing. 

But in fact, it takes a very hands-off approach. When you define a new type, you can choose how addition works for it, or what it means for an object of that type to be equal to something else.

The designers of lists decided that adding them to numbers wasn't allowed. 

The designers of numpy arrays went a different way (adding the number to each element of the array).

Here are a few more examples of how numpy arrays interact unexpectedly with Python operators (or at least differently from lists).



- When does 1 + 1 not equal 2?

Things can get weirder than this. You may have heard of (or even used) tensorflow, a Python library popularly used for deep learning. 

It makes extensive use of operator overloading.

- Curious how it all works?

Have you ever called help() or dir() on an object and wondered what the heck all those names with the double-underscores were?
